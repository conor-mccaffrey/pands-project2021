## Introduction 
This README file will serve as both an introduction to Fisher's Iris Dataset and as evidence of the applicability of Python in investigating datasets. I also intend to use this README file as a tool, demonstrating my thought process for using certain attributes, methodologies and functions when describing the data. The main goal here is to be able to demonstrate the knowledge I have gained throughout the module and use this knowledge to be able to discern information from the Iris Dataset.

I have structured the README file as follows:

    1. Overview of the Iris Dataset (background, application to Python)
    2. Investigation of the Fisher's Iris Data Set
    3. Conclusion
    4. References

## Overview of Iris Dataset, it's attributes, and it's application to Python

The Iris Fisher Dataset was first created in 1936 by Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher [1]. The dataset was desribed in his landmark paper 'The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems' (1936), attibuting the actual collection of the data to Dr. Edgar Anderson [1]. The Iris Dataset is essentially a multivariate dataset, containing 150 measurements of iris petal and sepal lengths and widths, with 50 measurements for each of the species 'setosa','versicolor' and 'virginica' [2]. It is important to note that these measurements are in centimetres (cm). Each class is linerally separable from the other two classes [3].

The measurements obtained were used to create a linear discriminant model to classify the species [4]. The dataset has become commonplace in computer science, in particlar pattern recognition literature [3]. The Iris Fischer Dataset has been used for data analyses so frequently that it can be accessed without needing to find a source, through both R and Python in the machine-learning (ML) package Scikit-learn [5]

I intend to use this dataset to demonstate my knowledge of Python, gained throughout the module. I will, in particular, be using the Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and perhaps Seabron modules throughout the project. These modules will be installed when required.

The overall goal is to use these modules (and by extension, Python) to describe the Iris dataset in detail and, display visually, certain attributes of the data which I believe are important to highlight. By doing this I will also, in essence, provide evidence of the suitability of Python towards analysing large datasets.
## Investigation of the Fisher's Iris Data Set  

#### Project Plan

To maintain structure and organisation during the project, I have set out a project plan for the investigation of the data-set. This is to ensure focus during the project and to avoid going down any rabbit holes.

    1. Create a repository on GitHub which I will clone onto Visual Studio as outlined during Week01 of the module, using SSH. I will call the repository 'pands-project2021' as requested.
    2. I will download the data for Fisher's Iris Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) and add it to my repository using the Pandas 'read_csv' atttribute.
    3. I will carry out exploratory research on the dataset to familiarise myself with the data and it's potential for Python analysis and reference all items I extract information from.
    4. I will then consider what type of analysis is relavant for this data set and investigate how to carry it out, drawing on various resources which will be references. This work will be stored in various different files.
    5. I will update the README file as I progress, and then compile all my work into a program called 'analysis.py'
